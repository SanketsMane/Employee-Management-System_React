# 🔐 SSH Direct Deployment Guide

## 📋 **What I Need:**

1. **PEM File**: Your AWS private key file
2. **Server IP**: Your EC2 instance public IP address
3. **Username**: Usually `ubuntu` for Ubuntu instances

## 🚀 **What I'll Do Via SSH:**

```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Create proper docker-compose file
# Pull latest verified images  
# Deploy the application
# Test and verify it's working
# Show you the results
```

## 📁 **How to Provide PEM File:**

**Option 1: Copy & Paste Contents**
```bash
# Just copy the entire content of your .pem file
# I'll create it locally and use it
```

**Option 2: Upload to Temporary Service**
- Upload to pastebin/gist (temporarily)
- I'll download and delete after use

## 🎯 **What I'll Fix:**

1. ✅ **Create correct docker-compose.aws.yml**
2. ✅ **Pull verified images with latest code**
3. ✅ **Start services properly**
4. ✅ **Test backend and frontend**
5. ✅ **Verify https://ems.formonex.in is working**

## 🔒 **Security:**
- I'll only use the PEM file for this deployment
- Delete it immediately after use
- No permanent storage

---

**Ready when you are! Just provide:**
- PEM file content
- Server IP address  
- Confirm username (usually `ubuntu`)

**And I'll fix your deployment immediately! 🚀**
