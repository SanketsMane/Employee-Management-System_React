# 🚀 Production Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Build Verification Complete!
Your `index.html` file is being generated correctly during the build process. If you're experiencing issues in production, it's likely a **server configuration** problem, not a build issue.

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. **Missing index.html in Production**

#### **Symptom:** 
- Build generates `index.html` locally
- File appears missing on the server
- Getting 404 errors for the main page

#### **Solutions:**

**A. Check File Upload:**
```bash
# Verify all files were uploaded correctly
ls -la /path/to/your/webroot/
# Should show index.html and assets/ folder
```

**B. File Permissions:**
```bash
# Set correct permissions
chmod 644 index.html
chmod -R 755 assets/
```

**C. Web Server Configuration:**
- **Apache:** Use the `.htaccess` file provided
- **Nginx:** Use the `nginx.conf` configuration provided

### 2. **Server Configuration Issues**

#### **Apache (.htaccess):**
```apache
# The .htaccess file is already created in your dist folder
# Make sure your Apache has mod_rewrite enabled
# And AllowOverride is set to All for your directory
```

#### **Nginx:**
```nginx
# Update your nginx.conf with the provided configuration
# Key points:
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### 3. **Path Issues**

#### **Problem:** Incorrect base path in build
#### **Solution:** Already configured in vite.config.js
```javascript
base: './' // Uses relative paths
```

### 4. **Build Asset Issues**

#### **Problem:** Assets not loading
#### **Solutions:**
- Check if `assets/` folder was uploaded
- Verify file permissions on assets
- Check browser console for 404 errors

## 🛠️ Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Run `npm run build:prod` successfully
- [ ] Verify `dist/index.html` exists
- [ ] Check all assets are in `dist/assets/`
- [ ] Test locally with `npm run preview`

### During Deployment:
- [ ] Upload ALL contents of `dist/` folder
- [ ] Include `.htaccess` file (for Apache)
- [ ] Set correct file permissions
- [ ] Configure web server for SPA routing

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test main page loads
- [ ] Test client-side routing works
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify API calls work (if applicable)

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Re-upload with Correct Structure
```bash
# Your server should have this structure:
webroot/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── index-[hash].js
│   ├── index-[hash].css
│   └── vendor-[hash].js
├── formonex-logo.svg
└── .htaccess (for Apache)
```

### Fix 2: Test Build Locally
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build:prod
npm run preview
# Open http://localhost:4173 to test
```

### Fix 3: Check Server Logs
```bash
# Check your web server error logs
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
# or
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

## 📱 Testing Your Deployment

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test if index.html is accessible
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/

# Test if routing works
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/dashboard

# Test if assets load
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/assets/index-[hash].js
```

### Expected Responses:
- Main page: `200 OK` with `text/html`
- Routes: `200 OK` serving `index.html`
- Assets: `200 OK` with correct MIME types

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

### Debugging Steps:
1. **Check browser developer tools**
   - Network tab for failed requests
   - Console tab for JavaScript errors

2. **Verify server configuration**
   - Ensure SPA routing is configured
   - Check if `.htaccess` is being read (Apache)

3. **Test with simple HTML**
   - Create a test `test.html` file
   - Upload and access it directly

### Contact Information:
If you're still experiencing issues, provide:
- Your hosting provider/server type
- Error messages from browser console
- Server error logs
- File structure on your server

## 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **Your build is working correctly!**

- Assets are bundled properly ✓
- File structure is correct ✓

🎯 **Focus on server configuration:**
- Upload all files from `dist/` folder
